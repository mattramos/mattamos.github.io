I'm an environmental data-scientist working on merging physical and statistical models together to generate better predictions of our ever changing world. My particular focus at the moment is on not only making better predictions of environmental systems, but also ensuring that we are estimating the uncertainty properly.

Currently I work on the [DSNE (data science for the natural environment)](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/data-science-of-the-natural-environment/) project, based in the maths and stats department at Lancaster University, but **am actively looking for either academic or industry research jobs**. As long as there are interesting and environmentally important problems to solve, I'm interested!
